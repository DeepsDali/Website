              Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I'm Deepa, originally from the bustling city of Mumbai, India.

              My passions are cooking Indian and Chinese dishes, baking, devouring books and watching shows on astronomy and recently coding.  I have had a long career mainly in marketing. 

              I have over 10 years of diverse work experience in brand management, digital marketing and retail environments in Mumbai and London.	After a career break to focus on my family am currently self-learning to code aiming to restart on a new career path of a web developer

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p class="text-me">
              I have a masters degree in Business Administration and BSc in Physics from Mumbai University. I started my career in brand management in managerial positions at multinational companies in Mumbai, India. After moving to the UK, I worked in the local council's education department and many other private companies. In my last role, I worked as a freelance Digital Marketing Consultant for a Consultant Surgeon's private practice. I helped design, manage and promote the practice websites. I got an opportunity to work with web developers which ignited my interest in software development.
           <br>  <br>
              I am inspired by the prospect of creative problem-solving and building tools to improve processess. I am a teamplayer and love to work in a collaborative environment. I am keen to secure
              an opportunity to further my coding skills and tackle development challenges which enhance user
              experience

            <h2>My coding journey</h2>
            <p class="text-me">
            I started my coding journey with the responsive web design course on Freecodecamp. I enjoyed making a survey form, landing and tribute pages with HTML and CSS on Codepen. I am also learning through various resources like Udemy tutorials, Coursera and Codecademy. A few months back I came across Founders and Coders and so far have immensely benefitted from attending the workshops and meetups. I believe strongly in their ethos to create a positive social impact with collaborative learning. I would love the opportunity to be a part of the cohort to further my learning with the help of supportive mentors and motivated co-learners and also to pay forward and make a difference by sharing my learning with others.

          <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p >As an astronomy enthusiast, I was excited when the James Webb Telescope was finally launched on Christmas day 2021. Why is it so special? The telescope uses infra red light to “see” all the way back to the first generation of stars created 13.5 billion years ago, just 300 million years after the Big Bang.
          </p><br><p> Check out my slider below to see some of my favourite images taken by the telescope this year. You can play and pause the slider or use the left and right arrows to browse at your pace. You can even try uploading any of your favourite images to my collection using the upload button.</p>
